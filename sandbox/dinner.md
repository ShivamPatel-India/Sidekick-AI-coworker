## Reviews
- "Absolutely delicious meal here. The food was hot and freshly cooked and the restaurant was beautifully decorated. The service was kind and fast. Really loved it!"  
- "The service is exceptionally friendly and good and the food outstanding. They have a salad section, tasty soup, and multiple meat and vegetarian options."  
- "I think India Grill is overhyped, overpriced, and extremely mid version of Indian food made to cater to Americans. But I would highly recommend trying the naan!"  
- "The food was amazing and service was quick. Almost the entire menu is marked gluten-free."
